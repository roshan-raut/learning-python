## What is the Python interpreter?

The Python interpreter is a program that runs the Python programs you write.


## What is source code?

Source code is the statements you write for your program—it consists of text in text files that normally end with a .py extension.

## What is byte code?

Byte code is the lower-level form of your program after Python compiles it. Python automatically stores byte code in files with a .pyc extension.

## What is the PVM?

The PVM is the Python Virtual Machine—the runtime engine of Python that interprets your compiled byte code.
