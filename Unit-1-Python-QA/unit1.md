## Why Do People Use Python?
1. Software quality

    Python’s focus on readability, coherence, and software quality in general sets it apart from other tools in the scripting world

2. Developer productivity

    Python boosts developer productivity many times beyond compiled or statically typed languages such as C, C++, and Java. Python code is typically one-third to one-fifth the size of equivalent C++ or Java code.

3. Program portability

    Most Python programs run unchanged on all major computer platforms

4. Support libraries

    Python comes with a large collection of prebuilt and portable functionality, known as the standard library. 

5. Component integration

    Python scripts can easily communicate with other parts of an application, using a variety of integration mechanisms.

## Is Python a “Scripting Language”?
Python is probably better known as a general-purpose programming language that blends procedural, functional, and object-oriented paradigms - a statement that captures the richness and scope of today’s Python.

## OK, but What’s the Downside?
The only significant universal downside to Python is that, as currently implemented, its
execution speed may not always be as fast as that of fully compiled and lower-level
languages such as C and C++. Though relatively rare today, for some tasks you may
still occasionally need to get “closer to the iron” by using lower-level languages such
as these that are more directly mapped to the underlying hardware architecture.

## Who Uses Python Today?
    • Google makes extensive use of Python in its web search systems.

    • The popular YouTube video sharing service is largely written in Python.

    • The Dropbox storage service codes both its server and desktop client software primarily in Python.
